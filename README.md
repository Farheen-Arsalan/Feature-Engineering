# Feature Engineering



We are generating a tremendous amount of data daily. In fact, 90% of the data in the world has been generated in the last 3-4 years! The numbers are truly mind boggling. Below are just some of the examples of the kind of data being collected:

Facebook collects data of what you like, share, post, places you visit, restaurants you like, etc.
Your smartphone apps collect a lot of personal information about you
Amazon collects data of what you buy, view, click, etc. on their site
Casinos keep a track of every move each customer makes

Backward Feature Elimination

Forward Feature Selection 

Principal component Analysis (PCA) # PCA 

Independent Component Analysis (ICA) # faster 

*t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
